Electropedia is produced by the http://www.iec.ch/[IEC], the world’s leading organization that prepares and publishes International Standards for all electrical, electronic and related technologies – collectively known as “electrotechnology”. Electropedia (also known as the "IEV Online") contains all the terms and definitions in the International Electrotechnical Vocabulary or IEV which is published also as a set of publications in the IEC 60050 series that can be ordered separately from the http://www.iec.ch/dyn/www/f?p=103:22:0::::FSP_ORG_ID,FSP_LANG_ID:1231,25[IEC webstore].

Electropedia is the world's most comprehensive online terminology database on “electrotechnology”, containing more than 22 000 terminological entries in English and French organized by subject area, with equivalent terms in various other languages: *Arabic*, *Chinese*, *Czech*, *Finnish*, *German*, *Italian*, *Japanese*, *Korean*, *Norwegian* (Bokmål and Nynorsk), *Polish*, *Portuguese*, *Russian*, *Serbian*, *Slovenian*, *Spanish* and *Swedish* (coverage varies by subject area).

The world’s experts in electrotechnical terminology work to produce Electropedia under the responsibility of http://www.iec.ch/tc1[IEC Technical Committee 1] (Terminology), one of the 204 IEC http://www.iec.ch/dyn/www/f?p=103:6:0[Technical Committees and Subcommittees].
