== Introduction

Geolexica is the site name of the online version of the ISO/TC 211 Multi Lingual Glossary of Terms.

This repository contains the source of the https://www.geolexica.org site.

The site is managed by the ISO/TC 211 TMG together with Ribose.

NOTE: This repository is only meant for internal consumption!


== How to add/remove entries or suggest changes?

For change suggestions, contact ISO/TC 211 TMG.

This terminology database is managed by the ISO/TC 211 TMG, and it only considers
requests from within ISO/TC 211. The database is not directly community-managed or community-sourced.


== ISO/TC 211 MLGT component overview

Components involved in ISO/TC 211 MLGT solution:

. Geolexica.org: **this repository**.
  Renders Geolexica database into HTML, JSON-LD and other Web-friendly formats.

. Geolexica database:
  see https://github.com/geolexica/geolexica-database[geolexica/geolexica-database].
  Hosts all concept data in YAML;
  bundles facilities for converting authoritative spreadsheet data into YAML.
  Candidate to become authoritative source, contingent upon factual usage of Glossarist by TMG.

. Manually managed XLST spreadsheets (1.0 workflow):
  see https://github.com/ISO-TC211/mlgt-data[ISO-TC211/mlgt-data].
  Currently the authoritative source in 1.0 workflow.
  Will be phased out in favor of Geolexica database in 2.0.

. Glossarist desktop application (2.0 workflow):
  see https://github.com/geolexica/geolexica-desktop[geolexica/geolexica-desktop].
  Will be used to manage the Geolexica database in 2.0 workflow.


=== Change lifecycle (1.0, current)

. Requested changes are directed to ISO/TC 211 TMG.

. When a change is approved, TMG publishes a new version of ISO/TC 211 "`Multi-Lingual Glossary of Terms`".

. TMG uploads the new MLGT version to mlgt-data repository.

. From the updated mlgt-data, a new snapshot of the database is created in geolexica-database repository.

. After new snapshot of the database is committed to geolexica-database,
  ISO/TC 211’s Geolexica.org is deployed with the latest database version.


=== Change lifecycle (2.0, near future)

. Requested changes are directed to ISO/TC 211 TMG.

. Adding, updating, approving concepts & terms in ISO/TC 211 Geolexica database
  is done by TMG using the desktop application under development.

. As changes are made, new versions of Geolexica database are created,
  and ISO/TC 211’s Geolexica.org is deployed with the latest database version.


== Internal operations

NOTE: These steps are only intended for the internal operator of the site!


=== Building the site

. Ensure geolexica-database submodule is up-to-date.

. Run ``make _site``


=== Deployment

Please push all changes to the `staging` branch, and changes will be automatically deployed and reflected on the staging site.

If your changes are to be made public to the production site, please contact Ribose.


=== Rendering of HTML

Jekyll is used to render YAML into HTML.

NOTE: Since Jekyll Collections have this flaw where YAML files can't be directly
rendered, a hack is implemented in the Makefile `_concepts` target,
so that every YAML file is converted into AsciiDoc by padding `---` at the end.
